# Contact Form Challenge

This is a responsive **Contact Form** project built as a frontend practice challenge. It was inspired by one of the design challenges on the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) platform.

The form includes input fields for first name, last name, email address, query type (radio buttons), message box, and a consent checkbox. JavaScript is used to validate the form and display a success message using SweetAlert2.
